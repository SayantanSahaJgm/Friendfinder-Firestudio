/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for FriendFinder App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data protection by implementing strict access controls based on user ownership.
 * Public data (e.g., posts, stories) is readable by all, while private data (e.g., user profiles) is accessible only to the owning user.
 * Write access is carefully controlled to maintain data integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile information, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /posts/{postId}: Stores user-generated posts, publicly readable but writable only by the post's owner.
 * - /posts/{postId}/likes/{likeId}: Stores likes for a specific post.
 * - /posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments for a specific post.
 * - /stories/{storyId}: Stores user stories, publicly readable but writable only by the story's owner.
 * - /friendRequests/{requestId}: Stores friend requests between users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data under /users/{userId}.
 * - Posts and stories are publicly readable, enabling a global feed.
 * - Only the owner of a post or story can modify or delete it.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototype phase except for ownership checks.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Posts and Stories denormalize user data (username, profilePictureUrl) to avoid additional reads during feed display.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public content (posts, stories) is stored in top-level collections, while private user data resides under /users/{userId}.
