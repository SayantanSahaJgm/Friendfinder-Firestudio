/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for FriendFinder App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data privacy and enforces a strict ownership model
 * for user profiles and associated data. Public readability is enabled for posts and stories,
 * but write access is carefully controlled.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data, accessible only to the user.
 * - /posts/{postId}: Stores public posts, readable by all but writable only by the owner.
 * - /posts/{postId}/likes/{likeId}: Stores likes for posts, writable only by the user.
 * - /posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments for posts, writable only by the user.
 * - /stories/{storyId}: Stores public stories, readable by all but writable only by the owner.
 * - /friendRequests/{requestId}: Stores friend requests between users, writable only if the user is involved.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data under /users/{userId}.
 * - Posts and Stories are publicly readable but can only be created, updated, or deleted by the owner (creator).
 * - Listing the /users collection is denied to prevent unauthorized access to user information.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  The 'Post' and 'Story' entities include denormalized 'user' data (username, profilePictureUrl)
 *  to allow for quick display without requiring additional reads. However, this data is
 *  not used for authorization decisions. Authorization is based on the 'userId' field.
