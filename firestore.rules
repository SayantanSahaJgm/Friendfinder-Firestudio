/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for FriendFinder App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure, user-centric data model. It leverages path-based ownership and denormalization to minimize reads and maximize security.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data. Access is strictly limited to the owning user.
 * - /posts/{postId}: Stores user posts.  Posts are publicly readable, but only the owner can modify or delete them.
 * - /posts/{postId}/likes/{likeId}: Stores likes for each post.  Only authenticated users can create likes. Users can only delete their own likes.
 * - /posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments for each post.  Only authenticated users can create comments. Users can only delete their own comments.
 * - /stories/{storyId}: Stores user stories. Stories are publicly readable, but only the owner can create them. Stories can be modified or deleted only by their owner.
 * - /friendRequests/{requestId}: Stores friend requests between users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally allowed, but can be restricted later using server-side filtering.
 * - Data validation is minimal in this prototyping phase, focusing on ownership and relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Posts denormalize user data (username, profilePictureUrl) to avoid extra reads during display.
