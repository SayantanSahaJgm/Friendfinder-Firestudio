/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for FriendFinder App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes data security by enforcing strict ownership and
 * access controls. It focuses on verifying user identity and authorizing
 * actions based on the authenticated user's ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, accessible only to the
 *   authenticated user with a matching ID.
 * - /posts/{postId}: Stores posts made by users, publicly readable, but only
 *   modifiable by the creator.
 * - /posts/{postId}/likes/{likeId}: Stores likes for each post. Only
 *   authenticated users can create likes, and only the like owner can delete.
 * - /posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments for each post. Only
 *   authenticated users can create comments, and only the comment owner can
 *   delete.
 * - /stories/{storyId}: Stores user stories, publicly readable, but only
 *   modifiable by the creator.
 * - /friendRequests/{requestId}: Stores friend requests, manageable only by
 *   the involved users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly denied due to the absence of a rule allowing
 *   it.
 * - Read-only collections are explicitly marked with `allow get, list: if true;`.
 * - Ambiguous relationships default to strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The rules assume that the 'userId' field within the documents in the
 *   'posts', 'likes', 'comments', and 'stories' collections is a reliable
 *   indicator of ownership. This avoids costly `get()` operations to check
 *   ownership.
