/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for FriendFinder App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure, owner-centric data model.  It enforces strict
 * ownership for user profiles and implements public read access with owner-only
 * writes for posts and stories. The rules avoid complex data validation in favor
 * of rapid prototyping but maintain strong authentication and authorization checks.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /posts/{postId}: Stores user-generated posts. Publicly readable but only writable by the post's author.
 * - /posts/{postId}/likes/{likeId}: Stores likes for a specific post.
 * - /posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments for a specific post.
 * - /stories/{storyId}: Stores user-generated stories. Publicly readable but only writable by the story's author.
 * - /friendRequests/{requestId}: Stores friend requests between users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied to protect user privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted for posts and stories to facilitate content discovery.
 * - All write operations are guarded by authentication and authorization checks.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Posts and stories MUST contain a `userId` field to enable owner-only write rules.
 *   This avoids costly `get()` calls to the `/users/{userId}` collection.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, while public content (posts, stories)
 *   is stored in top-level collections. This separation simplifies read/write rules and
 *   improves query performance.
