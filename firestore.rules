/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for FriendFinder App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data protection by implementing strict
 * ownership-based access control for user profiles and related data. It allows
 * public read access to posts and stories while enforcing ownership for
 * modifications.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only to the
 *   authenticated user with matching ID.
 * - /posts/{postId}: Stores user-generated posts, publicly readable but
 *   modifiable only by the owner.
 * - /posts/{postId}/likes/{likeId}: Stores likes for posts, only the
 *   authenticated user with matching userId can create a like.
 * - /posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments for posts, only the
 *   authenticated user with matching userId can create a comment.
 * - /stories/{storyId}: Stores user stories, publicly readable but modifiable
 *   only by the owner.
 * - /friendRequests/{friendRequestId}: Stores friend requests, only the recipient
 *   or sender can read or update friend request.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted to the /posts and /stories collections to
 *   enable a global feed.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user profiles and modifications to posts
 *   and stories.
 * - No data validation is performed in this prototype except for
 *   authorization-critical fields.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Posts and Stories include denormalized user data (username, profilePictureUrl)
 *   to avoid extra reads for display.
